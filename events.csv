Fifteen more projects are underway  with total capacity of 5 179 kilowatt. About 80 small waterpower stations are being built by local authorities & private businesses  mostly in mountains for daily water use & agriculatural products processing. Nepal has rich hydropower potential (25 000 megawatts)  only 0.5% of which has been installed. To use these resources  the government has adopted a policy of building large  medium  & small waterpower stations at the same time. Nepal has 4 big & hundreds of small rivers. They are developing their hydropower with Chinese cooperation. Sunkosi hydroelectric station with 10 050 kilowatt capacity & Pokhara hydropower station with 1 500 kilowatt capacity were constructed with Chinese aid in 1973 & 1983  respectively.,4

Usumacinta River,GTM,MEX,After years of public protest and delay  the Mexican government is moving ahead with a hydroelectric dam project that some environmentalists and archeologists say could damage the ancient center of Mayan civilization and the ecology of North America's largest surviving rain forest. The spokesman for the federal electricity commission denied that 1 or more dams planned for the Usumacinta River  which marks the border between Mexico and Guatemala  would produce such effects. The choice of a site has not been made for the dam whose construction should begin in 1994. While the Mexican government downplays its ambitions  it continues to suggest that it might expand the project later  possibly under an accord with Guatemala. Mexican energy officals disclosed new dam project two weeks after these comments. The countries began studies for a huge joint dam project on the Usumacinta river in 1980  but public protests  technical considerations and strife along the border delayed the plans. In May 1989  the Salina administration announced that the program had been cancelled because of Guatemala's concerns that it would destroy precious archeological sites. Yet one of the results of Salina's feb. 24 trip to Guatemala city was a new agreement under which Mexico will sell guatemala electricity.  ,2

Colorado River,MEX,USA,Construction of the world's largest desalting plant has begun and should be completed by 1987. The plant  located south of the Colorado River levee  is designed to solve the water quality threat to farming downstream.  American farmers divert water from the Colorado to fields and as runoff irrigation water leaches through salty sand on the way to the river  the salt content quadruples and makes the water useless to farmers downstream. Protests from Mexico resulted in a 1973 agreement. Representative Brown  a California democrat  has criticized the project and calls for buying and ending the production of the 65 000-acre Wellton-Mohawk irrigation and drainage district east of Yuma  from which the drainage water comes. Brown also encourages farm conservation measures.,3

Himalaya mountains,NPL,USA,"Nepal has hydroelectric power capacity  but neither Nepal nor India can harness the Himalayan waters withough international assistance. This subject is likely to come up on Wednesday in Washington  when King Birendra of Nepal pays a state visit to meet with President Reagan and officials of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As people continue to cut forests  rich soil that should sustain Nepal crops is ending up downstream  in rivers of India  subjecting millions of Indians every year to floods as dirt-clogged rivers overflow more easily and frequently. A United States official said tapping hydropower would bring ""quantum jump"" in Nepal's development  providing water and power for year-round irrigation. Nepal plans to construct 3 small hydropower plants in various parts of 3 major river basins--Karnali  Gandaki and Kosi. A big advantage of such projects is selling power to India. Project feasiblity will be studied by the World Bank  but India's assistance is being sought since they'll receive benefits. Both countries are reluctant to commit themselves to anything on the Karnali project until the dispute is setttled over what share each country should have on a smaller proposed hydropower station on the Pancheswar river  which forms the border between the countries.",0

Usumacinta River,GTM,MEX,After years of public protest & delay  the Mexican government is moving ahead with a hydroelectric dam project that some environmentalists & archeologists say could damage ancient center of Mayan civilization & ecology of North America's largest surviving rain forest A spokesman for the Federa Electricity Commission denied that 1 or more dams now planned on the Usumacinta River  which marks an isolated stretch of border between Mexico & Guatemala  would produce such effects. The choice among 3 site options has not been made for the dam whose construction should begin in 1994. Only a series of dams would be economically viable on the river. While the Mexican government downplays its ambitions  it continues to suggest that it might expand the project later  possibly under an accord with Guatemala. The project has received criticisms. Mexican energy officals disclosed new dam project 2 weeks later. The 2 countries began studies for a huge joint dam project on the Usumacinta River in 1980. But public protests  technical consdierations & strife along the border have altered & delayed plans. In May of 1989  Salina Administration announced that the program had been cancelled because of Guatemalan concerns that it would destroy precious archeological sites. Yet one of the results of Salina's Febuary 24 trip to Guatemala City was a new agreement under which Mexico will sell Guatemala electricity. And while Mexico officals emphasize that 1st new dam will be exclusively on Mexican soil & for Mexican consumption  they do not rule out joint project later on.,-2

On 2/6/89  under an Hungarian initiative  a protocol was signed to speed up construction by 15 months. The procedure set up for dispute resolution by the agreement has not been observed  as there has been no discussion with Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia reserves the right to express damage in monetary terms & seek payment for damages under the agreement. The CSSR government is ready to start talks with the government of Hungary with the aim of finding a joint path toward successful completion of Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water project.,-2

Colorado (CA canal),MEX,USA,The American government's plan to renovate a California canal has locked the US & Mexico in a major dispute over the use of water from the Colorado River. Mexico accuses the US of violating longstanding treaties  but American officals say they intend to move ahead with the project. One of Mexico's most productive agricultural areas is in question  as well as water supplies to Tijuana & Mexicali. L.A. & San Diego would be deprived of a water source if Mexico's position prevails. The issue has been referred to the International Boundary & Water Commission. Controversy is the result of an American proposal to reline the All-American Canal  which carries water from the Colorado River into California Imperial Valley  where it is used largely for irrigation. Currently  half the volume in the canal is lost to seepage  which flows underground across the border. Last November  the US Congress authorized the Department of Interior to reline a 66-mile stretch of the canal west of Andrade  California. Mexican officials claim the project violates a 1973 agreement on Colorado River water signed by the 2 governments. Mexican officials say they intend to protest in every possible manner. American officials have rejected Mexican complaints outright  saying that water diverted through the canal was part of the 1944 agreement. Settlement of the dispute is further complicated by the fact that the 1944 treaty does not address groundwater. Ybarra  a secretary to the American section of the International Boundary Commission  said that though no formal negotiations between the countries are taking place  the commissioners are involved in a process of information exchange. The dispute has transformed from a technical question to a highly political one. ,-3

Danube,CZS,HUN,A scientific conference among experts commenced at the Political College in Budapest on Monday on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water barrage projects to discuss a scientific survey prepared recently by an ad hoc committee of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Hungarian academics Stefanovits & Berczik  committee representatives  told MTI that the information available isn't sufficient to assess project risks. The committee concluded that studies & analyses conducted failed to consider several important aspects & interactions (e.g.  water quality). They said satisfactory survey of hazards would take 5-6 years  for which time project should be suspended. According to Lokvenc  the Czechoslovakia government commissioner of investment  the survey prepared by Hungarian side contains no new aspects to justify any radical measures. In his view  the 2-month period requested for suspension has expired & it is time to carry on with the works. The Hungarian government commissioner  Udvari  expressed that ample time should be given to Hungarian & Czechoslavakian scientists to study hazards  thus it is advisable to suspend project for longer period. He added  efforts are being made to reach an agreement & Hungary does not intend to take any unilateral steps.,
Danube,CZS,HUN,Hungarian & Czechoslovakian experts met here today for a joint 3-day conference to discuss the risks of constructing the Nagymaros dam  a part of the Czechoslovakia-Hungary Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water system on the Danube. At the conference  delegates were divided into working groups to study various aspects of construction & reasons for Hungary's suspension of construction. According to Udvari  the government envoy of Hungary  the aim of conference is to work out a joint stand of the 2 countries' scientists which is to be taken into consideration in definitive decision. Talks among experts are expected to be followed by talks between Premiers Adamec & Nemeth on 7/20.,1
Danube,CZS,HUN,In an open letter the opposition roundtable has asked Hungarian Premier Nemeth to review his standpoint related to building the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water barrage. Vigh  chair of the opposition roundtable  recalls that a discussion held by the premier on 5/24 allowed conclusion to be drawn that the review of the project would extend to a stretch of the Danube in Slovakia & that it'd lead to rethinking plans for the Gabcikovo power station. But at Hungary-Czechoslovakia expert talks that began yesterday  the Hungarian delegation of scholars was given the assignment of assenting to filling up the Dunakiliti reservoir  of consenting to running the Gabcikovo power station  & that a decision should be reached on building or abandoning the Nagymaros power station on the basis of Gabcikovo experiences in 3-4 years. Hungary expects from the compromise that inter-government relations with Czechoslovakia will not deteriorate excessively. In the letter  the opposition roundtable affirms that it's ready to give full support for a preliminary assessment of expected environmental damage & for working out responsible new agreements. ,
Danube,CZS,HUN,Kardos  asked the leader of the Hungarian delegation  Stefanovits  why joint communique will not be issued after 3-day expert talks with Czechoslovakia scientists & whether 2 stands are any closer to each other or if positions are the same as Monday when Czechoslovakia delegation announced they wish to continue work & they asked the same of Hungarian partner. The leader of the Hungarian delegation has said that the project has to be postponed further. Stefanovits replied: we have to say that no substantial change has taken place.    ,
Danube,CZS,HUN,The 3-day scientific conference on the Bos-Nagymaros project has ended. The Nagymaros project must be suspended for at least another 4-5 years. The 2 month suspension period that just passed was not enough even to list real water affairs  environmental protection  & other problems. This was formulated by the Hungarian delegation at talks held with Czechoslovakia scientists. Czechoslovakia answered concrete arguments saying that they've been dealing with similar matters for 30 years & that socialism has already solved more difficult problems. This did not reassure Hungarian delegation  thus joint communique will not even be issued.,-1
Danube,CZS,HUN,Adamec  the CSSR head of government  has ended his negotiations in Hungary about the Bos-Nagymaros project. Today Adamec said to reception committee that we shall settle matter of Gabcikovo-Nagymaros with Hungary by the end of October. In contrast  the most that Nemeth   Hungarian prime minister  could say at session of Hungarian government was that before the end of October he'd meet Adamec once more in order to come to a more definite position on the matter. Nemeth also said that experts from the 2 countries didn't form a joint position on significant ecologic and hydrologic issues  & therefore it appears that involvement of outside experts is necessary.,-1
Danube,CZS,HUN,Hungarian prime minister  Nemeth  gave a briefing to members of government on Thursday on Hungary-Czechoslovakia prime ministerial discussion held earlier in the day. Udvari  a government spokesman  praised the readiness of Czechoslovakia prime minister  Adamec  to reach a compromise. Hungary called attention to the fact that a resolution on suspension refers not only construction work on the Nagymaros dam but to other technological constraints on Hungarian stretch of Danube River also. Two proposals were made by Hungary. First  the project should be suspended for 3-5 years  during which time ecological hazards should be assessed by independent foreign experts. Second  he expressed readiness to start rechanneling river without delay  in case scientific research provided adequate information to guarantee reaching a firm decision on the project within 1 year. From Hungary's view  rechanneling the river bed & filling Dunakiliti reservoir cannot be accomplished in October this year  & thus related constructed cannot begin in August.,1
Danube,CZS,HUN,The prime ministers of Czechoslovakia & Hungary said today that studies & research would continue before they meet again on 10/31 to exchange objective information & make a final decision on the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water project on the Danube River. Hungarian premier Nemeth said consensus had been reached on some points but views were still wide apart on many important issues concerning ecological risks & water purity. Czechoslovakia premier Adamec said it's necessary to continue making patient  but not endless  assessments  & thus we agreed with Nemeth to make a final evaluation & make a decision at joint talks at the end of October.,1

Danube,CZS,HUN,The Hungary government considers Czechoslovakia's compensation claim following the suspension of the Nagymaros project unfounded. A note from the Council of Ministers  which is a reply to Czechoslovakian note from mid-August  emphasizes that the claim to compensation is unacceptable without talks. The Hungarian government again proposes consideration of its proposals & urges a reply of substance from the Czechoslovakia government. Hungary believes gains  losses  & risks should be born jointly. The note firmly rejects statement in Czechoslovakian note that says Hungary's move calls into question its credibility at dam talks. Possible countermeasures by Czechoslovakian side in connection with the suspension of rechannelling work would be regarded by Hungary as a breach of agreement on the barrage project.,-1

James Bay region & Great Whale River,CAN,USA,New York & New England power officials have become reluctant participants in a dispute over whether one of Canada's biggest utilities should expand its generating capacity. Utilities in the Northeast have purchased substantial amounts of power from the Canadian company Hydro-Quebec since the late 1970s. If the state cannot buy Hydro-Quebec power  new power plants would be needed  said NY Power Authority chair Flynn.  Hydro-Quebec wants to increase hydropower it generates from James Bay region in northern Quebec.

The Sierra Club & Crees have sued the authority  trying to block 2 new contracts to buy electricity from Hydro-Quebec. Buying power from Canada is cheaper than building plants & doesn't carry environmental problems of oil/coal-fueled plants. Canada's National Energy Board recently approved Hydro-Quebec's proposed sale of power to New York & Vermont utilities  but the board made sales contingent on a study examining environmental impact of the new James Bay project.,

Usumacinta River,GTM,MEX,After years of public protest & delay  the Mexican government is moving ahead with a hydroelectric dam project that some environmentalists & archeologiests say could damage an ancient center of the Mayan civilization & the ecology of North America's largest surviving rain forest. A spokesman for the Federal Electricity Commission denied that the 1 or more dams it now plans to build on the Usumacinta River  which marks an isolated stretch of border between Mexico & Guatamala  would produce such effects. A choice among 3 site options has not been made for the dam whose construction should begin in 1994. Only a series of dams would be economically viable on the river. While the Mexican government downplays its ambitions  it continues to suggest that it might expand the project later  possibly under an accord with Guatamala. The project has received criticisms. Mexican energy officals disclosed the new dam project 2 weeks later. The two countries began studies for a huge joint dam project on the Usumacinta in 1980  but public protests  technical considerations & strife along the border altered & delayed plans. In May 1989  the Salina Administration announced that a program had been canceled because of Guatemalan concerns that it would destroy precious archeological sites. Yet one of the results of Salina's February 24 trip to Guatamala City was a new agreement under which Mexico will sell Guatamala electricity & while Mexican officials emphasize that the 1st new dam will be exclusively on Mexican soil & for Mexican consumption  they do not rule out a joint project later on.,4

The protocol was signed Friday evening and foresees Turkey paying Bulgaria 12 cents for each square meter of water released from dam. Bulgaria will begin releasing water on Monday.

n/a,IRQ,UNO,United Nations Children's Fund head in Dahuk  Don McLean announced that health conditions have worsened rapidly for Iraqi Kurds since Baghdad cut off power two months ago to punish rebel Kurds. Clean drinking water is in short supply. Hospitals perform only emergency operations and can no longer properly store blood supplies and medicines requiring constant refrigeration.  ''All basic services here are electrically driven and people have never had to consider how to provide things like water and heating without electricity '' said McLean. Aid workers say many essential medical supplies are lacking due to restrictions associated with the three-year-old U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  Ghazi Abdullah Fandi  director of the city's main Azadi Hospital  said hospitals were short of everything from syringes to solutions to treat kidney failure in children  an increasing problem because of impure water. ''Since 1991  we have been living off old supplies and the materials we get from aid agencies. Now our stores are depleted and we don't get enough from aid agencies '' said Fandi.  Generators cannot meet the shortfall in power  forcing some people to rely on murky streams for drinking water.  Statistics from the Azadi Hospital show what aid workers and doctors called an alarming increase in certain illnesses. Typhoid cases in Dahuk city rose to 188 in September  from 41 in the same month last year. Diarrhoea cases just about doubled to more than 900 in September. In August there were 26 cases of hepatitis  more than twice the number in August 1992.,

Danube,HUN,SVK,Article reports on an interview with Slovakia President Kovac. He says: It's no longer an assumption - we can speak of an actual trend of improving relations between Hungary & Slovakia Republics. There are concrete signs that new Hungary government wants to begin talks immediately with Slovakia side  & not only on signing already drafted agreements but  above all  on a basic treaty between the 2 states. In addition  it seems that questions concerning Gabcikovo hydroelectric project will be assessed as an expert issue rather than political one.,0
Danube,HUN,SVK,Hungary Foreign Minister Kovacs received a group of Slovakia journalists in Budapest yesterday. In connection with the Gabcikovo-Nagymaors water project  Kovacs said that while many people in Slovakia view this project as a symbol of Slovakia independence  many people in Hungary see it as a memorial to their former system. We think that it is necessary to discard this factor of political prestige  while policy should make it possible to find solutions that  from technical  shipping  ecological  & economic viewpoints  can be considered to be the most suitable within the  framework of our possibilities. A related article reports: Kovacs said that Hungary will come to Bratislava by helicopter in order to view the Gabcikovo power project because the Hungary cabinet considers personal experience important. He added that in order to save flora-fauna of the Small Rye Island along the Danube in Hungary  it's necessary to come to a temporary agreement to divide the Danube waters to ward off ecological catastrophe. A basic treaty that provides a long-term framework for development of relations will help resolve dispute.,0

Jordan & al-Yarmuk Rivers & 'Arava + Lake Tiberias,ISR,JOR,Article documents a talk between anchor Yavin & Arab affairs correspondent Ya-ar regarding how the water problem was resolved. Beyond the agreement's general statement  the main focus was an equitable distribution of Jordan & al-Yarmuk water & the 'Arava  in terms of quantity & quality. Settlements in Arava that irrigate land from wells & are currently in the process of drilling will continue to receive waters in the same quantity and quality  even after land is relocated across the Jordan border. The agreement discusses need to search for practical solution for water managment & future discovery of water sources. Actual steps are:  50 million cubic meters will be accumulated by established dam at 'Adasiya near al-Yarmuk's estuary to Jordan. The dam will accumulate winter floods & al-Yarmuk's waters for Jordan's benefit  so that they can be used for irrigation purposes. Israel has promised to permit additional waters in similar quantities to flow south from the Deganya Dam with Jordan being permitted to use these waters by building additional dams across the lower part of the Jordan River. An important principle here is that neither Jordan nor any other Arab country has been granted foothold in Lake Tiberias  which remains exclusively a Israeli water source  although Israel has promised to allot Jordan a certain amount of water.,

Guadiana,ESP,PRT,In the Guadiana basin  there is opposition to a planned diversion to Guadalquivir because of affects to Portugal's poorest & driest agriculture region  the Alentejo  where some time ago the government took up a plan to construct the dam. However  Baltanas  the Spanish Director General of hydrological projects  recently asserted that construction of a diversion from the Guadiana River would be no problem because Spain & Portugal governments have common interests.

The 2 governments concern  Baltanas said  is to assess the possible adverse environmental effects on the Guadiana estuary & to not leave the river dry.,

Ganges (Farakka barrage),BGD,PAK,The 7 SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries meeting this week. Relations between Pakistan & India predominate. Also  the Indian government has been grievously remiss with Bangladesh in making no effort to settle the Ganges water dispute. The same policy that was pursued in 1950s & 60s of backing settlement with then Pakistan government over the Farakka barrage controversy has been studiously followed ever since. Then Bangladesh founded and new government under Sheikh Rahman was urged to accept a tentative arrangement for sharing Ganges water until more thorough & enduring settlement of the issue was found. Since then  no effort has been made to settle questions about water supply for Bangladesh's entirely agriculture-based econpmy. Rather  Bangladesh complains that ratio of water sharing has been changed for the worse. India's duty (in the author's view) is to help Bangladesh in this matter & thus there should be understanding with it's neighbor Nepal  if not China as well  since the principal river (Brahmaputra) flows thru all 3 countries.,
Ganges (Farakka barrage),BGD,IND,"Editorial titled ""No more assurances, We want the water."" India Prime Minister Rao again gave assurances in a news conference after the conclusion of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) that he hoped that a solution could be found for complicated water dispute between India & Bangladesh in the near future. On the basis of the meeting  secretary-level talks began. In 1992  Rao made more positive statement regarding the desire to solve the dispute & promised to see that no damage is done to Bangladesh due to the water problem. Afterwards  ministerial meetings were held  but nothing happened. Discussions stopped completely  then Bangladesh Prime Minsiter had to open closed doors in the discussion India doesn't realize Bangladesh water crisis  as indicated by Rao statement that he doesn't think withdrawal of water in upper the Bangladesh delta is a violation of human rights. The diversion of water at the Farakka dam was also addressed in the article. At the beginning  through many pacts  Bangladesh had some surety to receive some water  but situation doesn't existing anymore. No contract hsa been signed on the matter since 1988 & India never agreed to sign any contract. Thus  Bangladesh has not been getting water in the dry season for the last few years. As a result  there are environmental  economic  agricultural & industrial development problems in Bangladesh.",

? all shared basins --> Incomati  Limpopo  Maputo  & Umbeluzi,MOZ,ZAF,Concerns expressed by Mozambique about the use of South African water resources have not been accepted by its partners in the South African Development Community (SADC). Most of rivers that flow through Mozambique rise in other SADC countries. Mozambique authorities complain that South Africa in particular takes more than its fair share of water.

Jordan,ISR,PLO,Commentary. While Hebron remains a thorn in the flesh of Israel & Palestine negotiators  negotiating sides surprised many by reaching an agreement on a sensitive issue that is more important than Hebron  namely  water. The agreement is valid for interim period only & much remains open for final agreement. Palestinians want more water & full control over  or at least equal partnership in  water resources of their territory. The sides agree on Palestine's future water needs in the West Bank (70-80 million cubic meters). Palestine will receive additional water during interim period  partly from inside Israel  & Israel will drill a well to supply Janin & Gaza Strip with more water. A joint water committee will be established  the agenda of which will be decided jointly. The committee will permit drilling & new water uses. Palestine will manage own water affairs (specifically in the Gaza Strip  except Qatif Bloc wells). Joint management will occur only in the West Bank. In case of violation (sabotage or illegal use of water)  the two sides will undertake to make reparations.,

The joint parliamentary committee  comprising representatives of all political parties  was formed to supervise the execution of the Mahakali treaty  which Nepal officials hailed as the watershed in Nepal-India bilateral cooperation of water development on equal terms.,6

Nepal is now seeking a completely new treaty  after the all-party consensus reached on Friday. The old treaty (1992) has not yet been ratified by parliament. Nepal is now pitching for 3-4 times the amount of power & double the water from India. Since Nepal provided the land to build the dam at Tanakpur  India should give us more benfits than it's promised.

India State Minister for Water Resources  Ola  addressed a joint press conference with Bangledesh counterpart Razzak. Two questions remained unaddressed: how treaty will be implemented and whether flow at Farakka will be maintained by curbing withdrawel of water upstream of Farakka or by augmenting water flow from alternative source. When Ola was asked whether it was true that the West Bengal government was withdrawing water downstream of Farakka by a water pump in violation of the treaty  he evaded the question. When pressed  he said the ""matter will be looked into by technical committee."" Razzak said that India admitted that availability of water was less than what was envisaged in the treaty  but maintained that Indian government would take adequate measures to fulfill treaty.",0

Teesta River& Ganges River,BGD,IND,The leader of Indian delegation  Minister of State for Water Resources  Ola  has himself acknowledged that the flow of water had dropped owing to technical reason which will be sorted out by next dry season. Both countries would have been better off by now had the JRC been operational since inception in 1972. Politics kept the JRC unoperational and led to an accumulation of problems. Now  greater political cordiality is needed between the countries  so basic steps can be taken  like monitoring the flow of river water at important points across the border. It is also encouraging that water of the Teesta and other Rivers are going to be shared. India and Bangladesh share 52 rivers and are particularly prone to drought and flood  which one day could be brought under control through scientific cooperation. India showed concern for future when it encouraged Dhaka's aspirations to build Ganges barrage project  promising technical assistance. ,0

Mahakali River,IND,NPL,"1950-1991.Nepal has massive hydroelectric potential  but lacks financial resources. The present shortage of power is part of result of delays in building World-Bank funded the Arun 111 hydroelectric plant at the foot of Mt. Everest. Another energy issue is: Nepal felt shortchanged by ruling Nepal government in controversial Tanakpur barrage to be built on the Mahakali River by India. Opposition leaders of the Nepalese Communist Party said Prime Minister Koriala ""sold off"" Nepal interests to construction of the river dam when premier signed the Tanakpur Accord during his official visit to India in 12/91. Protests & a legal suit resulted within Nepal (see article for details). Indo-Nepal Treaty of Peace & Friendship signed between 2 countries in 1950 had provided the basis for cooperation for mutual benefits (since all rivers flowing in Nepal enter India). The 1st mutual beneficial water project was the Kosi project  built after agreement was concluded between the countries on 4/23/54. Tapping of the Kosi River consisted of a canal system  flowing channels on both side  a barrage & hydroelectric station. A revised agreement on the Kosi project was signed in 12/19/66 after a series of discussions between the two governments. The main provision was that any construction & other undertaking by India in connection with the Kosi project was to be planned & carried out in consultation with the Nepali government.",
