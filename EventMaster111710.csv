Clean drinking water is in short supply. Hospitals perform only emergency operations and can no longer properly store blood supplies and medicines requiring constant refrigeration.  ''All basic services here are electrically driven and people have never had to consider how to provide things like water and heating without electricity,'' said McLean. Aid workers say many essential medical supplies are lacking due to restrictions associated with the three-year-old U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  Ghazi Abdullah Fandi, director of the city's main Azadi Hospital, said hospitals were short of everything from syringes to solutions to treat kidney failure in children, an increasing problem because of impure water. ''Since 1991, we have been living off old supplies and the materials we get from aid agencies. Now our stores are depleted and we don't get enough from aid agencies,'' said Fandi.  Generators cannot meet the shortfall in power, forcing some people to rely on murky streams for drinking water.  Statistics from the Azadi Hospital show what aid workers and doctors called an alarming increase in certain illnesses. Typhoid cases in Dahuk city rose to 188 in September, from 41 in the same month last year. Diarrhoea cases just about doubled to more than 900 in September.

Mexico accuses the US of violating longstanding treaties, but American officals say they intend to move ahead with the project. One of Mexico's most productive agricultural areas is in question, as well as water supplies to Tijuana & Mexicali. L.A. & San Diego would be deprived of a water source if Mexico's position prevails. The issue has been referred to the International Boundary & Water Commission. Controversy is the result of an American proposal to reline the All-American Canal, which carries water from the Colorado River into California Imperial Valley, where it is used largely for irrigation. Currently, 1/2 the volume in the canal is lost to seepage, which flows underground across the border. Last November, the US Congress authorized the Department of Interior to reline a 66-mile stretch of the canal west of Andrade, California. Mexican officials claim the project violates a 1973 agreement on Colorado River water signed by the 2 governments. Mexican officials say they intend to protest in every possible manner. American officials have rejected Mexican complaints outright, saying that water diverted through the canal was part of the 1944 agreement. Settlement of the dispute is further complicated by the fact that the 1944 treaty does not address groundwater. Ybarra, a secretary to the American section of the International Boundary Commission, said that though no formal negotiations between the countries are taking place, the commissioners are involved in a process of information exchange. The dispute has transformed from a technical question to a highly political one. ",2,0,All American Canal,Issue referred to IBWC.

Borja last met Fujimori in December in Cartagena, Columbia following Fujimori's proposal to end the border conflict. At that time, Peru proposed that the two countries delineate their 640-km border, share navigation rights on the Amazon River and reduce military spending. After the border conflict began with a full-scale war in 1941, Ecuador lost 200,000 square km of territory, including jungle rich in oil and minerals, and access to the Amazon. There have been periodic outbreaks of fighting over the disputed border over the years.

The agreement, reached as a high-ranking Tajik delegation visited Kabul, marks the first exchange of missions between Afghanistan's new Islamic government and any of the former Soviet central Asian republics.  Afghan rebel forces captured the capital on April 25 in the climax to 14 years of civil war against a Soviet-backed communist government. Tajikistan borders Afghanistan to the north and the two have important economic and cultural ties.  About 30 per cent of Afghans are ethnic Tajiks, including the current president, prime minister and defence minister.  The Tajik delegation, which included Prime Minister Akbar Mirzoyev, arrived in Kabul on Tuesday and met Afghan President Burhannudin Rabbani at a state dinner that evening.  In addition to agreeing on an exchange of missions, the two governments discussed the supply of Tajik electricity to Afghanistan and the export of Afghan natural gas to Tajikistan.  ''Tajikistan supplies electricity to parts of northern Afghanistan and we are looking to expand that service,'' Jalil Shams, the Afghan Deputy Foreign Minister, told reporters on Wednesday. ''We also discussed the joint exploitation of our countries' hydroelectric resources,'' he added.  The Tajik delegation left Kabul by air en route to Dushanbe on Wednesday afternoon.  Afghan foreign ministry sources said the diplomatic exchange with Tajikistan would be at the charge level because the new Islamic government in Kabul has not yet appointed ambassadors to any countries.",3,0,,ARAL?

Their meeting reviewed a Damascus accord under which Syria agreed to curb activities of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Lebanon's Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley. Turkish officials at the talks in Ankara had sought to allay Syrian fears of a cut in the waters of the Euphrates river that flow into Syria over the border, Harba said.

At one post, on the Chormagzak Pass, the Russian soldiers had been virtually held hostage for three days by bands of 400 to 500 armed men on each side, he said. The Russians were asked to guard the pass, big industrial plants and the Nurek hydroelectric dam by acting President Akbar Iskandarov, who took over on the resignation early this month of ex-Communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev.  They have now pulled out of all but the dam. ''There I will fight to the last cartridge,'' Ashurov told Interfax.  Local officials estimate several hundred people have been killed in fighting between foes and allies of Nabiyev over the past few weeks.

In the letter, a copy of which was sent to Reuters, SCIRI said the situation in the marshlands had further deteriorated since mid-July, when it called on the U.N. to send aid and to ask the Iraqi government to stop draining the marshes. It said then Baghdad had drained about 70 percent of the marshlands, killing most of the livestock and fish.

In 1992, Rao made more positive statement regarding the desire to solve the dispute & promised to see that no damage is done to Bangladesh due to the water problem.
